    Okay, you''re around the corner. No
    one can see you. You think.

    

    Bit tough to hear yourself think above
    the thumping machinery. However, in front of you is the emergency exit door.
    It has an oversized, cast iron lock hanging from a bolted handle. You could try
    picking the lock, or maybe look for a way to pry it off.

    

    What to
    do?

    

    1. Pick it.

    2. Pry it.'
