    In front of you is the expanse of the airship
    hangar.

    

    Festers are running everywhere and mostly yelling at one
    another. Some men are clambering aboard airships, others are attempting to put
    out fires that have started from the explosion.

    

    Who were those men?
    Friend or foe? That will have to wait. Time to get out of here.

    

    What
    now?

    1. Mad sprint to the nearest airship.

    2. Quick scrounge for
    weapons, then mad sprint to the nearest airship.'
